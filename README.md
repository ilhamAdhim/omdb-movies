# OMDB Movies Web App

## Project Overview

This is an application that uses OMDB API

In the project directory, you can run `npm i` to install all dependencies required then run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode. Open to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

If you want to run this project locally, you can generate your free API key [here](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx) manually and set it to the `.env` variable.

For the website in deployed URL, it's pre-configured on my behalf so that the user can explore and interact the website freely.

## Possible Improvements

- To make more customized UI with more developer-experience, we can utilize Tailwind CSS or Chakra UI. Both these options have easier implementation of responsive web design as well.
- `Redux` may be a good option for the larger scale application. In this case, it is quite an overkill. Alternatively, simpler application can use `React Context API`.
